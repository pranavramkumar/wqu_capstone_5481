> This is the open Git repo for the WorldQuant University Capstone Final Project Submission for Group 5481 </br>
The group members included Pranav Ramkumar, Artis Jhamar Johnson and Ekoue Jean Kougnah </br>
Pranav focussed on datasets, Artis focussed on model-selection and model training, and Kougnah focussed on literature review

## Technologies used
`GoogleSheets` was used as the datasheet to assemble the feature vectors and target matrix into datasets </br>
`Python-based` preprocessing tools, and data aggregators were used for curating individual vector data </br>
`Python` and its libraries have been used as the tool of choice for exploratory analysis and deep learning based modeling and forecasting of carbon allowance prices. </br>
The following libraries are required to execute the .ipynb files in this git repo: 
  * os, csv, sys, and drive from google.colab (optionally to mount google drive path)
  * numpy, pandas,datetime, math
  * matplotlib (specifically pyplot, mdates, mpatches, LineCollection, Colormap, ListedColormap, BoundaryNorm, MonthLocator, DateFormatter)
  * seaborn
  * yfinance, pandas_datareader
  * statsmodels - seasonal_decompose (from seasonal), SimpleExpSmoothing and ExponentialSmoothing (from holtwinters)
  * tensorflow, xgboost (XGBRegressor)
  * torch, torch.optim, torch.nn
  * CEEMDAN_LSTM
  * sklean.model_selection (train_test_split, GridSearchCV, cross_val_score, RepeatedKFold)
  * sklearn.metrics (mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_percentage_error)
  * tensorflow.keras.layers (Dense, Activation, Dropout, LSTM, GRU, Flatten, BatchNormalization)
  * tensorflow.keras.models (Sequential, load_model)
  * tensorflow.keras.optimizers (Adam)
  * tensforflow.keras.callbacks (ReduceLROnPlateau, EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint)

## Git repo structure
The data folder contains:
* `raw` folder > contains the datasets for RGGI, California, Korea, EU-ETS and China with headers extended feature sets; also contains an .xlsx consolidate file with links in headers to official data sources used
* `processed` folder > only the target vector and feature matrix (X1-X14) selected for model-fit and forecasting
* `pre-processing` folder > contains pre-processing done before assembling vectors into dataset in .xlsx format (which includes linear-model estimations)
  
The git repo contains:
* Accompanying paper in .pdf format
* `ExploratoryAnalysis.ipynb` which encompasses all exploratory inquiries asked of carbon allowances prices as an asset class
* `Diagnostics.ipynb` which contains stationarity, collinearity and trend analysis of individual vectors within each dataset
* `Forecasting.ipynb` which contains model definitions, model-fit, hyperparameter optimization and loss-function reporting for all models

## Project Information
Here is some outlining information about the project:
  * **Motivation**: The motivation for this research is to bring financial engineering skillsets to the field of carbon pricing with the view to demonstrate how carbon allowance prices may be forecasted using some popular machine learning models with the view to construct portfolios of allowance prices to securitize an ETF for institutional investors 
  * **Goals**: asdas
  * **Unique contributions to literature**: asdas
  * **Lessons learnt**: asdas

## Project Scope
*In scope:*
1. Five ETSs namely - RGGI, California Cap and Trade, Korea, EU ETS, and China ETS (average of Beijing and Shanghai pilots)
2. Exploratory analysis to establish that a 'Carbon Allowance ETF' presents a diversified asset class for institutional investors
3. Study of historical regulatory policies of the five ETSs, to investigate if investing in five ETSs smoothens the stresses from one
4. Predicting allowance prices into the future for five ETSs with 3 different model types (CEEMDAN-LSTM, XGBoost and Transformer)
5. Reporting three different loss functions in and out of sample namely MAE, RMSE and MAPE

*Out of scope:*
1. Extensive Feature Engineering: does not include energy-system variables, or NLP-based feature engineering
2. ETF Construction: Methods to construct an ETF as a portfolio of spot allowances, or allowance futures using portfolio optimization methods and benchmark portfolios
3. Scenario Development for Long-Term Forecasts: Feature Vectors have not been forecasted into the future using expert judgment and priors, statistical methods (like cholesky decomposition), or from predictions generated by macroforecasting or climate forecasting models
4. Carrying out long-term forecasts (out to 2030 or 2050) and back-testing financial and environmental impact of the carbon ETF constructed

## How to contribute to this project
As you can see from the accompanying paper, there are severe limitations to the way the data has been sourced, the feature set considered, the model train-test splits and validation routines (doesn't include walk-forward, cpcv or kcv validations), and how an ETF has been constructed using the forecasts. Given the future scope of this project, if you would like to take this work further and collaborate with the authors, contact Pranav by raising a new issue.
