# Forcasting carbon allowance prices across five emissions trading systems using deep learning (2017-2023)


## Essential information
This is the open Git repo for the WorldQuant University Capstone Final Project Submission for Group 5481 </br>
The group members included Pranav Ramkumar, Artis Jhamar Johnson and Ekoue Jean Kougnah

## Technologies used
GoogleSheets was used as the datasheet to assemble the feature vectors and target matrix into datasets
Python-based preprocessing tools, and data aggregators were used for curating individual vector data
Python and its libraries have been used as the tool of choice for exploratory analysis and deep learning based modeling and forecasting of carbon allowance prices. The following libraries are required to execute the .ipynb files in this git repo: 
  * os, csv, sys, and drive from google.colab (optionally to mount google drive path)
  * numpy, pandas,datetime, math
  * matplotlib (specifically pyplot, mdates, mpatches, LineCollection, Colormap, ListedColormap, BoundaryNorm, MonthLocator, DateFormatter)
  * seaborn
  * yfinance, pandas_datareader
  * statsmodels - seasonal_decompose (from seasonal), SimpleExpSmoothing and ExponentialSmoothing (from holtwinters)
  * tensorflow, xgboost (XGBRegressor)
  * torch, torch.optim, torch.nn
  * CEEMDAN_LSTM
  * sklean.model_selection (train_test_split, GridSearchCV, cross_val_score, RepeatedKFold)
  * sklearn.metrics (mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_percentage_error)
  * tensorflow.keras.layers (Dense, Activation, Dropout, LSTM, GRU, Flatten, BatchNormalization)
  * tensorflow.keras.models (Sequential, load_model)
  * tensorflow.keras.optimizers (Adam)
  * tensforflow.keras.callbacks (ReduceLROnPlateau, EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint)
